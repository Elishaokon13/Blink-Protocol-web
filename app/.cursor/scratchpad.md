# Blink Protocol KYC System Development

## Background and Motivation

Continuing the 22-week KYC system development project for Blink Protocol, we have now progressed to **Phase 3: Identity Verification Core**. This phase focuses on building the core identity verification infrastructure that will handle document verification, biometric processing, and risk assessment for KYC compliance.

Previous phases completed:
- **Phase 1**: Project Foundation & Initial Setup (Tasks 1.1-1.4) ‚úÖ 
- **Phase 2**: Authentication Layer Integration (Tasks 2.1-2.4) ‚úÖ

Current phase: **Phase 3: Identity Verification Core (Tasks 3.1-3.4)**

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Phase 3 Technical Challenges:
1. **Type Safety**: Building a comprehensive type system for verification workflows
2. **Service Architecture**: Creating a singleton verification service that manages state
3. **Processing Simulation**: Implementing realistic document and biometric processing workflows
4. **React Hook Integration**: Building hooks that work seamlessly with the verification service
5. **UI/UX Flow**: Creating intuitive step-by-step verification wizards
6. **Test Coverage**: Ensuring comprehensive testing for all verification scenarios

### Solutions Implemented:
- Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces with 5 verification levels and 13 document types
- Singleton verification service with in-memory session management
- Simulated processing workflows with realistic timing and confidence scores
- React hooks with real-time polling and error handling
- Progressive UI wizard with step indicators and file upload validation
- 28 comprehensive test cases covering all service functionality

## Lessons

### Technical Learnings:
1. **Prisma in Tests**: Mock database imports before requiring verification service to avoid browser environment issues
2. **Singleton Pattern**: Use proper singleton pattern for verification service to maintain state consistency
3. **Test Isolation**: Clear service state between tests to prevent interference
4. **Async Processing**: Use setTimeout simulation for realistic processing workflows
5. **Type Imports**: Import types as values when using enums and error classes

### Architecture Decisions:
1. **In-Memory Sessions**: Using Map for session storage during development phase
2. **Polling Strategy**: 3-second polling interval for real-time UI updates
3. **File Validation**: 10MB limit with format restrictions for document uploads
4. **Error Hierarchy**: Custom error classes for different verification scenarios
5. **Step-by-Step Flow**: Progressive disclosure for complex verification workflows

### Best Practices Established:
1. Comprehensive TypeScript typing for all verification scenarios
2. Singleton service pattern for state management
3. Real-time UI updates through polling hooks
4. Progressive wizard UI for complex workflows
5. Extensive test coverage for all service methods
