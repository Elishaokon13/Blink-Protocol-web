# Universal KYC Identity Platform - Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

The user wants to build a **One-Time KYC with Reusable Verifiable Attestations (v2)** - a privacy-preserving, user-controlled identity verification system that enables users to complete KYC once and reuse verified attestations across multiple platforms.

### Current Problem:
- Traditional KYC processes are segmented and siloed
- Each platform/service requires its own separate verification process
- This creates friction and inefficiency for users
- Complicates compliance for digital services, especially financial and Web3 applications
- Users must repeatedly verify their identity across different platforms

### Proposed Solution:
- A unified, blockchain-backed KYC platform with reusable verifiable attestations
- Users complete verification once and can seamlessly prove their identity across any integrated service
- **Zero PII storage** - all sensitive data encrypted client-side and stored on decentralized networks
- **User-controlled access** - users approve/deny data sharing via cryptographic signatures
- **Selective disclosure** - ZKP-based proofs allow sharing specific attributes without revealing full data
- **Multi-provider support** - flexible KYC adapter supporting multiple verification providers

## Key Challenges and Analysis

Based on the detailed architecture document, the key technical and business challenges include:

### **Technical Architecture Challenges:**
1. **Privacy-First Design**: Implementing client-side encryption with zero PII storage on backend
2. **Multi-Provider KYC Integration**: Building a flexible adapter system for multiple KYC providers (Smile Identity, Onfido, Trulioo)
3. **Decentralized Storage**: Integrating with Filecoin and Arweave for encrypted data storage
4. **Access Control**: Implementing Lit Protocol for granular access control with user consent
5. **Attestation System**: Integrating Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) for tamper-proof off-chain attestations
6. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Implementing ZKP for selective disclosure (e.g., proving age > 18 without revealing birthdate)
7. **Authentication Abstraction**: Implementing Privy for account abstraction with Passkey fallback

### **User Experience Challenges:**
1. **Web3 Complexity Abstraction**: SDK-driven architecture to hide blockchain complexities
2. **Seamless Authentication**: Email/phone/social login via Privy with fallback to Passkeys
3. **User Consent Management**: Intuitive UI for approving/denying data access requests
4. **Cross-Platform Integration**: Easy SDK/API integration for external platforms

### **Security & Compliance Challenges:**
1. **Regulatory Compliance**: Meeting global KYC/AML requirements while maintaining privacy
2. **Encryption Standards**: AES-256-GCM for data encryption with secure key management
3. **Tamper-Proof Attestations**: EAS integration for verifiable, signed attestations
4. **Device Security**: Secure enclaves and hardware-backed keys for encryption
